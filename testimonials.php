                            <p>The depth Mauro goes to to open the Sunday Gospel is astounding. Mauro's teaching is 100% Catholic, and will bring something new to everyone, whatever their level of understanding of the Faith and their knowledge of the Scripture.</p>

                            <p>We met as a little group in the church hall, watched together and stayed all behind after the session to discuss the questions. This was the best way to exchange, share and grow together in the Holy Spirit. Only two of us could be at the hall for the last session, but we met the others on Zoom, and could still have our discussion group going.</p>

                            <p>Our bonds of friendship are strengthened, and I feel Mauro and Janet's mission to serve the Church is spot on.</p>

                            <p>Presenting the course online must have been a challenge, and I know you will both get better and better.</p>

                            <p>Thank you so much to you, Mauro and Janet, for stimulating my brain and my heart, and bringing me closer to God. All my prayers go to you.</p>

                            <p>Just SO surprisingly interesting and informative! Mauro's infectious enthusiasm and his analysis interspersed with interesting historical facts and (often surprising) connections within the Bible, lures and retains one's attention.</p>

                            <p>These are such good courses and and what at first sight seems like a rather dry proposition (reflecting on a bible reading for an hour) is fascinating.</p>

                            <p>Mauro always manages to enthuse his listeners/course participants! Even friends who had left the faith, willingly tuned in each week - after attending the first session!</p>

                            <p>I feel completely blessed by the Advent Bible Series (as I have by all the courses I have taken with comeandsee.org to be honest), it has brought the scripture to life for me and helped me to see things in a totally new way.</p>

                            <p>I love that the sessions are live and that I am taking part with others from all over the world at the same time - it gives me such a feeling of fellowship.</p>

                            <p>Mauro's teaching is inspired and has helped me draw closer to God and to grow in faith since my recent return to the Catholic Church after an absence of many years and I would recommend it to anyone at any stage on their journey of faith.</p>

                            <p>It was lovely to 'meet' Janet too - thank you for all you do behind the scenes and for your wonderful prayer. I am sure that the Holy Spirit is greatly at work through Mauro, Janet and comeandsee.org - what a blessing!</p>
